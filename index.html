        <h1>For You, Likamva</h1>
        <p class="poem">
            From the moment I saw you, something felt right,<br>
            Like a star in my sky, shining so bright.<br>
            Your laughter’s a melody, your presence a song,<br>
            With you by my side, I know I belong.<br><br>

            That night at the Matric Dance, you took my breath away,<br>
            Every smile, every dance, I wished time would stay.<br>
            The way you laughed, the way you shone,<br>
            Made the night the best I've ever known.<br><br>

            Every call we share, every word we say,<br>
            Brings joy to my heart in the sweetest way.<br>
            Your voice, your thoughts, the way you just *are*,<br>
            Feels like home, no matter how far.<br><br>

            So here’s my heart, open and true,<br>
            Asking if I can be more than a friend to you. ❤️
        </p>
