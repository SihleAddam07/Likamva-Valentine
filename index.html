        <h1>For Likamva</h1>
        <p class="poem">
            Likamva, from the moment I met you,<br>
            Something in me changed—something I never knew.<br>
            Your smile, so warm, like the sun at dawn,<br>
            Made me realize where my heart belongs.<br><br>

            I've tried to hide it, tried to be strong,<br>
            But the truth is, I've loved you all along.<br>
            Every laugh we’ve shared, every moment near,<br>
            Has only made my feelings clear.<br><br>

            You are more than just beautiful—you are light,<br>
            A presence that makes everything feel right.<br>
            And no matter how much I try to pretend,<br>
            I can’t deny what I feel in the end.<br><br>

            So here it is, my heart in these lines,<br>
            No more hesitations, no more signs.<br>
            Likamva, I don’t just like you—I love you, it's true,<br>
            And all I want… is a chance with you.<br>
        </p>
